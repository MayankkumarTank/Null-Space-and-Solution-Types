# Null-Space-and-Solution-Types
This is the project of Linear Algebra which we have done in the 3rd semester of BTech. So the practical implementation of "find the null
space of given m x n matrix" problem through C programming is here, Kudos ;)

# How to run :-
- run the main_function.c file in your C compilor.
- all other C files are already added as a header files in each other files, so don't worry about it.
